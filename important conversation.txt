Ok hi LMFAO
[8:51 PM]
Sorry I wanted to take care of myself before you started ranting

Domo — Today at 8:51 PM
This isn't a rant, it's a conversation :0

same — Today at 8:51 PM
Idfk dude every time you try to talk to me it’s just to lecture me

Domo — Today at 8:52 PM
It really isn't
A majority of the time we talked in the past you were saying a lot to me
I have screenshots since like,,, it sucked that you were cursing at me-

same — Today at 8:53 PM
well that was because you were accusing me of gaslighting you
[8:53 PM]
And then proceeded to message my friends about me gaslighting you and breaking us apart
[8:53 PM]
Which btw thanks
[8:53 PM]
Thanks sm

Domo — Today at 8:54 PM
Whether intentional or not, what you said at some points was textbook gaslighting and I couldn't just let that slide
And I literally tried everything before texting other people about this situation, but nothing has ever stopped this stuff from happening
but let's just take this one at a time so that it doesn't turn into yelling again

same — Today at 8:54 PM
I apologize if I’m ‘being hostile’, as you would say
I’m just sick of you constantly going out of your way to harass me
[8:54 PM]
It’s been two fucking years
[8:54 PM]
Please leave me alone
[8:55 PM]
I’m genuinely tired of this
[8:55 PM]
I just wanna vibe in my corner pls

Domo — Today at 8:55 PM
I never wanted to harass you, I literally only texted nanner because I had no other idea how to get my s/o to stop lying to me and going back to you other than separating you
And you said really, really vile stuff to me back then

same — Today at 8:55 PM
???

Domo — Today at 8:55 PM
And for the record

same — Today at 8:55 PM
Because you were fucking harassing me??
[8:56 PM]
For shit I did when I was 12????
[8:56 PM]
12
[8:56 PM]
12 man

Domo — Today at 8:56 PM
I can get the screenshots
If you wanna call my talking to you harassment, that's unfair

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 8:56 PM
Plus technically i feel like it was shit i did

same — Today at 8:56 PM
Honestly not rlly

Domo — Today at 8:56 PM
Exactly

same — Today at 8:56 PM
We both were just rlly dumb tbh LMAO
[8:57 PM]
I was a traumatized 12 year old and u were just lonely

@Domo
I can get the screenshots If you wanna call my talking to you harassment, that's unfair

same — Today at 8:57 PM
I’ve seen the screenshots
And the shit you sent to my friends?
Only me being ‘hostile’

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 8:57 PM
That doesn't really excuse the pain I caused her either way though, even if I am trying to be better about it

@richiefromtheditchie
That doesn't really excuse the pain I caused her either way though, even if I am trying to be better about it

same — Today at 8:57 PM
Fair, obviously cheating isn’t a good thing
[8:58 PM]
But Domo honey it’s been like

Domo — Today at 8:58 PM
I'll get the worst stuff I've sent you then

same — Today at 8:58 PM
Two years you have to fucking let go????
[8:58 PM]
I’m literally 14 now
[8:58 PM]
I’ve moved on
[8:58 PM]
I have a wonderful boyfriend
[8:58 PM]
And my life is different now

Domo — Today at 8:58 PM
Let me speak for a moment about this specifically

same — Today at 8:58 PM
And I’m different now

Domo — Today at 8:58 PM
Like
uninterrupted

same — Today at 8:58 PM
god you never let me talk
[8:58 PM]
Or listen to me

Domo — Today at 8:58 PM
I am, I'm asking to talk

same — Today at 8:58 PM
god whatever sure just do it

Domo — Today at 8:59 PM
If you have something more to say, go ahead dude

same — Today at 8:59 PM
Nah nah you ain’t gonna listen so just
[8:59 PM]
Go ahead

Domo — Today at 8:59 PM
I'm offering you my ear

same — Today at 8:59 PM
What kinda awful shit have I done to u(edited)

Domo — Today at 9:00 PM
Okay then
Well, it hasn't been two years, it's been one and a half, which you may have changed significantly since then which I respect, but
As to me, my side of this
[9:01 PM]
It started in april 2020, and every few months there's more lying and hiding things and more hurt that's caused because of you or this situation
I want to move on so, so fucking bad, but I can't when you're being lied for and hidden from me for months on end

same — Today at 9:01 PM
Domo

Domo — Today at 9:01 PM
And it isn't because I haven't moved on
I haven't moved on because of this

same — Today at 9:01 PM
You know why we have refused to tell you shit?
[9:01 PM]
Why we want to avoid telling u anything?
[9:01 PM]
It’s because of exactly this
[9:02 PM]
Harmless jokes
[9:02 PM]
Literally harmless ass jokes
[9:02 PM]
You get upset over
[9:02 PM]
And you make a whole scene
[9:02 PM]
And even get our friends involved?
[9:02 PM]
Like dude please we just want to be friends
[9:02 PM]
If Koba had just cheated on you, etc etc, I would understand you
[9:02 PM]
But you’ve gone out of your way to make my life a living hell
[9:02 PM]
And I’m so tired of it
[9:03 PM]
Please, I beg that you just let me live my life
[9:03 PM]
And let your partner make their own choices
[9:03 PM]
Two years, year and a half
[9:03 PM]
Whatever
[9:03 PM]
But please, just stop talking to me
[9:03 PM]
I want nothing to do with you anymore

@Domo
It started in april 2020, and every few months there's more lying and hiding things and more hurt that's caused because of you or this situation I want to move on so, so fucking bad, but I can't when you're being lied for and hidden from me for months on end

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:03 PM
i hate to say it but I really do feel like you're blaming other people for my own actions
You're perfectly welcome to hold me accountable, hun
I can say that you have every right to be upset at me

@same
I want nothing to do with you anymore

Domo — Today at 9:04 PM
do I get to speak?

@Domo
do I get to speak?

same — Today at 9:04 PM
Do I get to be heard?
[9:04 PM]
Without being called a fucking gaslighter

Domo — Today at 9:04 PM
I'm still listening dude

same — Today at 9:04 PM
Seriously that’s some bottom of the barrel shit dude
[9:04 PM]
No joke
[9:04 PM]
Why would you say that about me
[9:04 PM]
Like holy shit

Domo
Whether intentional or not, what you said at some points was textbook gaslighting and I couldn't just let that slide And I literally tried everything before texting other people about this situation, but nothing has ever stopped this stuff from happening but let's just take this one at a time so that it doesn't turn into yelling again

Domo — Today at 9:05 PM
Whether intentional or not, you said those things
[9:05 PM]
And hun
[9:05 PM]
I'm not blaming him for stuff you've done, I was just explaining I can't move on unless the lying stops which
I know it was you, I just hate saying it

same — Today at 9:06 PM
Domo you literally grabbed things from April to make me look bad to my friends
[9:06 PM]
What the fuck is wrong with you?
[9:06 PM]
I don’t even have the energy to argue just
[9:06 PM]
What the hell??

Domo — Today at 9:07 PM
I know this won't mean anything to you, but
I'm really, truly sorry for driving your friends away from you
I never wanted that to happen, I only asked nanner to have you leave because she offered it when I explained the situation
I don't want this to affect anyone more than it already has, and I'm really sorry for doing that

same — Today at 9:08 PM
I understand that, and I’m glad
But why would you outright say I was a ‘hostile person’ and that I was ‘gaslighting you’
[9:08 PM]
Intentional or not
[9:08 PM]
Don’t even type ok
[9:08 PM]
Gaslighting is supposed to be done
[9:08 PM]
ON PURPOSE
[9:08 PM]
I was just telling you the facts from the source????
[9:09 PM]
That your partner was unhappy with how you were treating them?
[9:09 PM]
And you go out of your way to call me a gaslighter
[9:09 PM]
All because I said something you didn’t want to hear
[9:09 PM]
I’ll admit, you’ve said things I don’t want to hear, yet I still accept that I’ve made my fair share of mistakes too

Domo — Today at 9:10 PM
I see where you're coming from
I didn't really think about how that would affect you, which is really, really fucked up of me
I'm sorry

same — Today at 9:10 PM
That’s all I wanted to hear, and I’m glad you realize just how fucked up that was
[9:10 PM]
Because dude, I lost an entire friend group in an instant
[9:10 PM]
All because you called me a gaslighter
[9:11 PM]
And specifically grabbed screenshots of me being ‘hostile’
[9:11 PM]
You know, I genuinely did think at first “hey, maybe this person is cool, and that they’re not bad at all”
[9:11 PM]
But I’m sorry, you’ve fucked with me for too long
[9:11 PM]
And I’m so sick of this situation
[9:11 PM]
I’m sick of you and I’m sick of this
[9:11 PM]
And I’m sorry to be harsh
[9:11 PM]
But fuck

Domo — Today at 9:11 PM
May I say a few things?

same — Today at 9:12 PM
Sure I guess

Domo — Today at 9:13 PM
Firstly, I honestly can't imagine what that would have been like to go through
I shouldn't have called you that, and again, I'm really sorry for doing so
I know a simple apology won't fix the wound, but I just want you to know I realize how terrible that was

same — Today at 9:13 PM
I’m just glad you even realized it was bad
[9:13 PM]
Honestly I’m so happy you aren’t completely up your ass
[9:13 PM]
Like I was relieved to hear that

Domo — Today at 9:15 PM
Second, 
One thing about this situation that makes it extremely hard to navigate is that Koba doesn't tell me how they feel
Hearing everything from your point of view, I can understand why you'd see me the way you do
Me being a "Selfish, self entitled, toxic partner that doesn't deserve them"
I know that I've definitely not been the best partner, but above everything else I've tried my hardest to give Koba every opportunity to tell me if they aren't happy
[9:16 PM]
And a lot of the time, they simply don't
And twice now, have they vented to you about the things they're unhappy with, and I had to learn about it all through you
[9:16 PM]
It isn't your fault that this has happened, but it makes it really hard to fix the problems that they have in the relationship when they don't tell me about them

same — Today at 9:16 PM
And that’s fair
[9:17 PM]
Though, here’s the issue
[9:17 PM]
From what I’ve heard you in general don’t do much to help when they actually do vent to you
Or get defensive when they tell you how they really feel
[9:17 PM]
And you really need to fix that because nothing will get fixed if you’re getting defensive like that
[9:18 PM]
Obviously Koba gotta talk to you more and be open, but even then, they’re too used to backlash or you just rambling about your problems on top of them
[9:18 PM]
And that brings me to yet another thing
[9:18 PM]
You’ve gotta stop dragging our friends into our personal drama
[9:19 PM]
It’s doing nothing but making things more complicated

Domo — Today at 9:21 PM
About the me being defensive thing
That is something that happens with me
I try my hardest to not let it happen, but it does. I'm still working on it as much as I can
But when they talk to me about problems they have with the relationship, or they're upset about something, I do absolutely everything I can to help them, no matter what
And about your friends, I never wanted to, and I shouldn't have. Seeing that they lied again about this all made me extremely panicky and I ended up texting some people to try and deconfirm what I was scared about, and when they didn't respond I tried deleting the message but they had noticed, which ended up in me explaining this to them
[9:22 PM]
@richiefromtheditchie 
I wanna ask your opinion on this too, how hard do you feel I try when it comes to helping you?

same — Today at 9:22 PM
Koba btw
[9:22 PM]
Be honest ok
[9:22 PM]
Genuinely
[9:22 PM]
Like for once be 100%
[9:25 PM]
Also wait rq since y’all need some McFucking relationship advice can I drag my bf’s fat ass over here

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:25 PM
At first it did feel like you were trying your hardest, but oftentimes it feels like you get upset too and I end up having to care for you instead
At some point I'd convinced myself that I would be fine living my life like that but of course, that was wrong
That week in December of last year? It was the literal worst week of my life because I refused to let myself get comfort because I felt like it'd just circle back to you again

@same
Also wait rq since y’all need some McFucking relationship advice can I drag my bf’s fat ass over here

Domo — Today at 9:26 PM
I'd prefer if you didn't give us relationship advice, at least not until we're done with everything going on here-
[9:26 PM]
but

@Domo
I'd prefer if you didn't give us relationship advice, at least not until we're done with everything going on here-

same — Today at 9:27 PM
May i still drag Malewife

Domo — Today at 9:27 PM
Honey, I'm so, so sorry
You wouldn't be fine living like that, I'm sorry for ever making you feel that way
I just want you to know that every single time that you're upset, or you have a problem in the relationship, I really do try my hardest to fix it
I mean that with all of my heart
[9:28 PM]
and
I suppose so?
[9:28 PM]
but as I was saying

same — Today at 9:28 PM
Bet malewife time

Domo — Today at 9:29 PM
I have situations like that as well
The exact same way you described it, where I don't want comfort because I feel like it'll circle back around to you
I'm really sorry for this

same — Today at 9:29 PM
Y’all sort out ur shit lemme grab the femboy

@Domo
Honey, I'm so, so sorry You wouldn't be fine living like that, I'm sorry for ever making you feel that way I just want you to know that every single time that you're upset, or you have a problem in the relationship, I really do try my hardest to fix it I mean that with all of my heart

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:31 PM
Thank you, honestly I was terrified to explain this stuff to you-
And yeah, I'm also really sorry for making you feel like that. I can kind of easily feel when you're not actually happy but my dumb ass just went with it
I forgive you, and thank you for understanding

Domo — Today at 9:31 PM
But honey, can you please, please be 100% with me about everything?
[9:32 PM]
Right now, it feels like there never really has been a time like that in our relationship
And I want things to get better, and I want to fix the problem you're having, but if you aren't telling me the truth I just can't

same — Today at 9:32 PM
Yea
[9:32 PM]

I know, and I'm really sorry. I'm gonna do my best with telling you the truth from now on, even if it's incredibly difficult
Domo — Today at 9:35 PM
I don't want to put pressure on you with this, but I really need you to, honey
I've never been angry at you for telling me how you feel
It's upsetting to know that I'm hurting someone I care for this much, but more than feeling upset I want to fix all of this
Okay?
richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:36 PM
Okay
Thank you, sweetie, I'm really sorry about all this stuff
Domo — Today at 9:36 PM
There's something I wanna ask now though,
You told me that the stuff stryker said to Nanner was exaggerated, but was it really?
same — Today at 9:37 PM

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:38 PM
Juuust a bit
Stryker, I understand getting pissed but you kinda,,,left out some portions
same — Today at 9:38 PM
They didn’t let me explain much, and it was just the April argument that Domo used
And I was freaking tf out
Cus Domo literally made the friendgroup leave me LMAO
richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:39 PM
Yeah, that's definitely fair
Domo — Today at 9:39 PM
^
same — Today at 9:39 PM
Like bro wtf was I gonna do write a five page essay on the full story like man I was just on the bus shaking

PLS
SH
richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:41 PM
Like,,,god that sounded so rude-
It feels weird to have two completely different in tone conversations at once
same — Today at 9:41 PM
wait what did
richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:41 PM
Me saying reel it in
same — Today at 9:41 PM
Oh LMAO
Idk what you even meant by that so ur ok
i forgot to respond — Today at 9:42 PM
its fine he probably dont know what reel it in means #wap
and neither do i
same — Today at 9:42 PM
We both stupid
Domo — Today at 9:42 PM
I think they're asking if we could tone down the,, very excitable stuff since this is a really really important conversation to us
Feel free to correct me if that was wrong, hun-
same — Today at 9:43 PM

Yep
same — Today at 9:43 PM
cállate perra
i forgot to respond — Today at 9:43 PM
ok alr ill stfu:punch:
same — Today at 9:43 PM
yea just for a sex
A SEC
Domo — Today at 9:44 PM
But I wanted to say that 
Because I was in the mind that you'd gaslighted me intentionally, when you said the stuff to nanner and my s/o said you stretched it, it made my vision of you a lot worse
Of course now I don't think you meant to do any of that, but I do think you could do with better word choice and phrasing-
same — Today at 9:45 PM
Once again
Bro
I was literally on the bus shaking and panicking I couldn’t think right and my heart was hurting so bad
Like idk what you wanted from me I get that I exaggerated some things but bro I was having a full ass panic attack
Domo — Today at 9:46 PM
That's completely understandable, it was only a thought
same — Today at 9:46 PM
Yea well honestly set that aside cus genuinely I was just terrified
And I do apologize if I said anything too harsh
I was just scared
Domo — Today at 9:48 PM
I also wanted to talk about what's gonna happen from here on
Of course I'm going to do my best to be a better partner for Koba, and they're gonna do their best to stop lying to me, but
One thing I can not shake on whatsoever, and I apologize for this, is that I will not ever be okay with you to being friends or being around each other
With all of the lying and hiding things, and with how long it's gone on without stopping, I just cant be okay with that
That's my one boundary in this that I absolutely can not budge on
same — Today at 9:48 PM
That’s like the main ass reason we been lying to u we wanna be friends LMAO
Like I do get it but idk it sucks we just wanna hang out
Domo — Today at 9:49 PM
I get that
But you understand why I feel this way
same — Today at 9:50 PM
I’m sorry but do u just rlly not trust Koba that much?
Like idk rlly I get it but I also feel like it’s just kinda shit
Domo — Today at 9:51 PM
I found out about the winter wonderland server and I called them about it, they told me they were sorry and they were gonna try their best to be better
I told them that I believe in them, I had faith in them that they wouldn't lie to me again even if I have no prior reason to trust me, and they lied to me about you a few hours later
And even then,
same — Today at 9:51 PM
But like
You got mad about some fictional characters dude
Nessy isn’t Koba and Silvio isn’t me
They’re just some goofy ass characters we made for plot and shit
Domo — Today at 9:52 PM
I'd like to talk for a bit uninterrupted, if that's okay
So.. I got upset about that because I'd expressed that it was a boundary for me previously, and they accepted it without any problems
And then I saw that you two made them fuck
Which it isn't the act of making two fictional characters fuck without explicit detail that bothers me, it's that they lied about it and told me they were completely fine with my boundary
And it's not a matter of trust on this one
I know you're gay, I know you have a bf, I know that Koba wants to be with me
But it brings be back to mentally horrid place when I think about you two talking with each other
Also about the thing with them
Koba, didn't you say you felt pressured into having stuff happen with nessy and silvio?
???
[9:54 PM]
tf
[9:54 PM]
nah cus Koba I stg if u been lying to me too
[9:54 PM]


richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:56 PM
I'm sorry,,
I didn't really expect it to go that way and when it did I didn't really say anything cause I didn't wanna make it weird
The regular shipping stuff I thought was fine mostly

same — Today at 9:57 PM
Bruh why didn’t u say shit I’m

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:57 PM
because I'm a pussy, Stryker

same — Today at 9:57 PM
Bro you need a genuine lesson on how to say fucking no omg
[9:57 PM]
How many times I gotta tell u
[9:58 PM]
Genuinely holy shit u coulda just said something and I woulda stopped bruh
[9:58 PM]
Ok now I’m pissed
[9:58 PM]
Bruh both of y’all now

richiefromtheditchie — Today at 9:58 PM
I'm sorry man
Genuinely

Domo — Today at 9:58 PM
Please don't be upset at them for this

Koba, you need to learn how to stand up for yourself and say no to people or things you’re not comfortable with, because it has proven to be a burden for you constantly 
Domo, you need to think before you do things, and check your wording before spreading misinformation to people
[9:59 PM]
God I’m hella disappointed
[10:00 PM]
Well not rlly I’m just glad Domo apologized

Domo — Today at 10:02 PM
I've pretty much said most of what I wanted to say
Though one last thing.. It really does feel like you give a lot of advice to us, Stryker
I do appreciate some of it, but a lot of it tends to just be telling me or sometimes them what to do without thinking about like
If we can work it out
[10:02 PM]
Which
I know we can

same — Today at 10:02 PM
Yeah but here’s the thing
[10:03 PM]
I’m a very honest person and everything I’ve been saying is just the harsh truth
[10:03 PM]
Because Christ you two need to quit babying each other
[10:03 PM]
It’s keeping y’all from actually improving on yourselves
[10:03 PM]
I’m happy to give advice, but y’all better be using it because y’all need it
[10:04 PM]
Seriously this entire situation in itself has been such a fucking mess and now I feel like you both are definitely at fault
[10:04 PM]
I’m sorry to be so blunt but dude, both of y’all, you gotta speak your damn minds

Domo — Today at 10:04 PM
You told me that I should've left them, and you told them that they should've left me
What you're saying is honestly true, but those types of things are what I'm saying I appreciate, while you telling us we should split up is just kinda fucked up to me
If you knew they were lying to me, then honestly I would've loved it if you'd have helped them stop lying to me instead of telling them we shouldn't be together

hi Domo
[10:05 PM]
so uh
[10:05 PM]
idk if u noticed
[10:05 PM]
But me saying you should leave them was uhhh
[10:05 PM]
Idk
[10:05 PM]
Like more than 7 months ago
[10:05 PM]
At the time I didn’t know much
[10:05 PM]
And now I know way more
[10:05 PM]
So my opinion has changed
[10:05 PM]
But at the same time it really hasn’t
[10:06 PM]
You both need a damn break from relationships
[10:06 PM]
No joke
[10:06 PM]
Seriously y’all can’t handle this shit I’m so sorry

Domo — Today at 10:06 PM
Please don't tell us what to do again

same — Today at 10:06 PM
It’s been so long and you’re both still hiding things and tryna do everything to find out what the other is hiding
[10:06 PM]
I’m not telling you what to do
[10:06 PM]
I’m telling you what your reality is right now
[10:06 PM]
Because you both need to see it

Domo — Today at 10:07 PM
And you're now telling me that what you're saying is fact and shouldn't be questioned

same — Today at 10:07 PM
Domo
[10:07 PM]
Please just listen to my words and actually try to understand for a second
[10:07 PM]
Please
[10:07 PM]
Like just take it with a grain of salt at least
[10:07 PM]
Just hold on ok
[10:08 PM]
Anyway, so please
As I said before, you both need to work on yourselves a lot
And I mean a lot
All the stories I’ve heard from both sides have brought me to the conclusion that y’all both done fucked up
[10:08 PM]
Which once again, obviously don’t do everything I’m saying immediately
[10:09 PM]
I’m saying that if fixing yourselves doesn’t work, and nothing changes in the future
[10:09 PM]
I’m sorry, but maybe y’all just ain’t right for each other
[10:09 PM]
Because seriously it’s been a long wild ride and I haven’t seen much change
[10:09 PM]
And I’m hoping after today you both do actually do something
[10:09 PM]
And hopefully things work out in the end for you both
[10:10 PM]
Which Domo, before you attempt to bring me down again, this is not meant to be negative
[10:10 PM]
Really what I’m just tryna say in general is y’all
[10:10 PM]
Seriously
[10:10 PM]
Just mfing take a break
[10:10 PM]
Or fix yourselves
[10:10 PM]
Either one
[10:10 PM]
Y’all can’t keep goin with the lies and shit ok

Domo — Today at 10:11 PM
You could've just said if it doesn't work out then you might need a break,,,
I see what you're saying, but this is what I said about phrasing and stuff

same — Today at 10:11 PM
Oh my god Domo

Domo — Today at 10:11 PM
Okay, I'm sorry

same — Today at 10:11 PM

[10:12 PM]

[10:13 PM]

Domo — Today at 10:19 PM
Okay, so..
Me and Koba decided this together
We're gonna both be breaking off our relationship with you Stryker
It's not because either of us hate you, but
You heard what I said earlier
I don't think I'd be okay if you two could talk together, and they recognize that and value our relationship enough for this
I really, really hope this situation gets better now, and I'm looking forward to the future with them after these scars have healed for the both of us

same — Today at 10:19 PM
